#LinkList

###By Ellen Lehman

##Set Up
To set up this program, clone the repository from Github.  To set up the database on your computer, run rake db:schema:load. You can run the program locally by using http://localhost:3000/ or you can find it online at:__________________________________.


##What It Does
This program allows a teacher to help his/her students discover great resources on the internet.  A student can create a 'profile' and can add website links to their profile.  The students need to include why they chose that link as a useful resource.

##Known Bugs
At this time, the teachers cannot add multiple classes or prevent students from editing their classmates' resource links.  Ideally in the future, this web application would allow students to upvote or downvote students links based on their usefullness/validity, provided they include an explanation of their vote.
